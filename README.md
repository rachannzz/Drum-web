# Drum Web Duplicate with WEB BOS

## Introduction

This project is a duplicate of the Drum Web project inspired by the TOP  Project curriculum. I created this project as a part of my learning process for Event Handling and DOM Manipulation using WES BOS HELP .



## Project Overview

The Drum Web Duplicate is a simple web application that allows users to play drum sounds by clicking on buttons or pressing corresponding keyboard keys. It's a fun project that demonstrates the power of Event Handling and DOM manipulation in web development.

## Technologies Used

To build this project, I used the following technologies and tools:

- HTML: For creating the structure of the web page.
- CSS: For styling the web page to make it visually appealing.
- JavaScript: For implementing the functionality of the Drum Web Duplicate.
- For interacting with the DOM (Document Object Model) and handling events.

## Features

- **Interactive Drum Kit**: Users can click on the drum buttons or press keyboard keys (A, S, D, F, J, K, L) to play corresponding drum sounds.

- **Responsive Design**: The web application is responsive and can be used on various screen sizes, including mobile devices.

- **Sound Feedback**: Each button press triggers a drum sound and a visual feedback animation, creating an engaging user experience.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/drum-web-duplicate.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Click on the drum buttons or press the corresponding keyboard keys (A, S, D, F, J, K, L) to play drum sounds.

## Project Structure

Here's a brief overview of the project structure:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.

- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the web page.


- `sounds/`: A directory containing sounds used in the project.
